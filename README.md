# Learnership Agreement Automation System

## Project Overview

This project aims to automate the process of signing learnership agreements by allowing both learners and human resources (HR) to sign the form online. Once both parties have signed, the system will automatically generate and send the agreement in PDF format to both the learner and HR. This eliminates the need for back-and-forth emailing, significantly saving time and ensuring that both parties have a copy of the signed agreement.

## Key Features

- **Online Signing**: Both learners and HR can sign the agreement directly through the system, streamlining the signing process.
- **Automated PDF Generation**: Once both signatures are collected, the system automatically generates a PDF of the signed agreement.
- **Instant Delivery**: The signed PDF is instantly sent to both the learner and HR, ensuring both parties receive the agreement without any delays.
- **Time-Saving**: The system eliminates the need for manual emailing, reducing the time spent on administrative tasks.
- **Secure Storage**: The signed agreements are securely stored and can be retrieved if needed.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Speeds up the process of signing and distributing agreements.
- **Reliability**: Ensures both parties receive their copies of the signed agreement immediately.
- **Convenience**: Allows for online signing, removing the need for physical meetings or exchanges of documents.
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduces the costs associated with printing, scanning, and mailing agreements.

## How It Works

1. **Form Submission**: The learner fills out the learnership agreement form online.
2. **Digital Signatures**: Both the learner and HR digitally sign the form through the system.
3. **PDF Generation**: The system generates a PDF of the signed agreement.
4. **Automatic Distribution**: The PDF is automatically sent to both the learner and HR.
